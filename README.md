# ☕ Café Inventory Management System

A smart, web-based inventory tracker designed for café owners who want simple yet powerful stock control. This system automatically adjusts ingredient stock levels based on daily menu orders, helping streamline operations and reduce waste.

## ✨ Features

- 📋 Define and manage ingredients (e.g. coffee beans, milk, cups)
- 🍽️ Create menu items and link them to ingredient-based recipes
- 🛒 Log daily orders and track usage in real time
- 📉 Auto-calculate remaining stock after each order
- 🚨 Low-stock warnings and customizable thresholds
- 💾 Save and retrieve data with `localStorage` (no backend required)

## 📦 Tech Stack

- HTML5 + CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)  
- LocalStorage (client-side data saving)  
- Optional: Google Sheets integration (coming soon)

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Add ingredients and current stock levels  
2. Create menu items and define recipes  
3. Log orders throughout the day  
4. Inventory updates automatically based on ingredient usage

## 🔄 Example Workflow

- Latte = 10g beans + 200ml milk  
- Order 2 Lattes → System subtracts 20g beans & 400ml milk from stock
